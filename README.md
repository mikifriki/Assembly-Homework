# Assembly-Homework
This is a short Assembly code I had to make as Homework. 
I used Microprocessor Simulator for students to write the assembly code and test it. (http://www.softwareforeducation.com/sms32v50/index.php)
So far everything seems to be working.


The Homework was to display the input of your keyboard on the programs VDS (Virtual Display)
